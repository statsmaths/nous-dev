                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p>NOUS arose from a simple observation: Louisiana and the Gulf South’s French and Creole cultures are reenergizing the region and are positioned to create new cultural and business opportunities.</p>
                        <img class="img-fluid img-top-bottom" src="images/faces.png" alt="alternative"/>
                        <p>NOUS supports and amplifies the full potential of these opportunities. A nonprofit organization based in New Orleans, Louisiana, NOUS is raising funds to build a globally renowned cultural institute dedicated to French and Creole. This dynamic space will feature three components: a thought-leading idea lab that will host workshops, conferences, and networking events; a vibrant café that will serve as a social space; and a concept store dedicated to the French-speaking world. The institute will also sponsor local and global exchange by providing scholarships and grants across disciplines.  </p>

                    <div class="text-container">
                        <p><b>NOUS brings us together&mdash;French for us, NOUS promotes Louisiana and the Gulf South’s French and Creole cultures and reinforces our role as an integral part of the French-speaking world.</b></p>
                        <p class="left-red">Today presents a unique opportunity because Louisiana recently became the first U.S. state to join the <i>International Organization of the Francophonie</i>, through an initiative that NOUS’s founders launched and spearheaded. The Francophonie brings together 88 regions and countries with over 1 billion people. NOUS is channeling this momentum into a vibrant, people-oriented space where local and global exchange across the French-speaking world becomes a reality. </p>
                        <p><b>NOUS brings <i>new</i> possibilities&mdash;Pronounced <i>new</i>, NOUS is reimagining how a cultural institute can be a creative, social, and economic pillar. </p></b>
                        <p class="left-blue">Ideas thrive when we create together, and a diversity of languages unlock new ways of thinking. Louisiana and the Gulf South retains its unique legacy of the largest concentration of French and Creole speaking communities in the United States. These languages have the full potential to create new opportunities. We do not have to look far: knowledge of French in Canada’s two most bilingual provinces, Quebec and New Brunswick, boosts annual trade by $9 billion because their bilingual services make them a preferred partner for French-speaking businesses from around the world.  Inspired by these possibilities, NOUS will provide an experience where everyone can learn, socialize, and create in a multilingual space.</p>
